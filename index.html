        <h2>
            TIME FOR A COURT MONITORED PROBE INTO <br> THE SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT DEATH CASE <br>
        </h2>
        <p class="cc">
            Actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his residence in Mumbai's Bandra on June 14, 2020. <br> The
            Mumbai
            Police immediately claimed it was suicide, but facts, evidence and testimonies that <br> have since emerged
            have
            cast a shadow around this initially-floated narrative. <br> <br>



            Sushant’s father approached the Patna Police, which registered an FIR against Rhea Chakraborty <br> and
            others on
            charges of Abetment to Suicide, Cheating, Conspiracy, among others. The family has <br> since said they
            suspect
            murder. The Bihar Police has, alleging non-co-operation from their <br> counterparts in Mumbai, recommended
            a CBI
            probe to the Centre but the Maharashtra Government <br> has petitioned to the Supreme Court against this
            move. <br> <br>



            Republic Media Network is in the pursuit of the truth. The network has carried out deep <br> investigations,
            confronted key witnesses, accessed crucial primary testimonies, stung multiple key <br> individuals and
            exposed
            the botch-ups of the Mumbai Police; and will continue to do so until the <br> truth emerges, in its
            entirety.
            While our investigative teams continue their pursuit for the truth,<br> Republic Media Network now humbly
            turns
            to you - our dear viewers and users - to come together <br> and join the campaign for justice for Sushant
            Singh
            Rajput. Join the petition for <span class="lol"> #CBIForSSR.</span> <br><br>

        <h2>
            WHAT IS THIS PETITION?
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is a petition to demand that the investigation into the death of Sushant Singh Rajput be <br> transferred to
            an independent and impartial organisation for a Supreme Court monitored time bound <br> inquiry. We believe
            nothing short of this will bring the whole truth out. <br>

            Join the Republic Media Network Campaign for #CBIForSSR to ensure that the cloud over the <br> circumstances of
            actor Sushant’s death are removed, that the truth prevails, and that those who <br> have compromised the
            investigation so far face penalties under the law.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="why">
        <h2>WHY #CBIForSSR</h2>
        <p>
            We have seen time after time how there have been botched up investigations and closure reports in mysterious 
            cases despite demands made by the families of victims. It is time to collectively rise and roar #CBIForSSR 
            so that no more botch-ups, no more pre-judged narratives and no more inconsistencies take place in the 
            interest of the entire truth and complete justice. The need of the hour is for a full, fair and transparent 
            probe guaranteeing justice for SSR (Sushant Singh Rajput). Here are some reasons why, we believe, it is time 
            to unite and petition for a court monitored CBI probe: <br> <br>

           <span class="spa"> REASON 1: THERE IS NO F.I.R. BY THE MUMBAI POLICE:</span> ​The Mumbai Police has till the launch of this petition
            (17th August 2020) not filed a single FIR in the case. This happened despite the fact that even before
            Sushant’s death, the family had approached the Mumbai Police informally raising concerns about a threat to
            his life. <br><br>



            <span class="spa"> REASON 2: THE MUMBAI POLICE ACTIVELY PEDDLED A SUICIDE THEORY BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETE:</span> ​Within
            24 hours, top Mumbai Police officials officially stated, "It is an apparent suicide.” In fact, even the
            Mumbai Police Commissioner said Sushant Singh Googled for terms like “painless death”, “schizophrenia" and
            "bipolar disorder" almost pushing the suicide narrative. We believe that it is improper for the Mumbai
            Police to cast aspersions on the conclusion of their probe, even before the probe concludes. <br> <br>



            <span class="spa"> REASON 3: THE TESTIMONIES CALL FOR A DEEPER PROBE:</span> ​Republic Media Network stung Sushant’s cook Neeraj who
            was in the house on 14th June. He made stunning revelations about how Sushant’s body was “tilted” and
            “wasn’t above the bed”. This raises questions and could debunk the suicide theory, thus forming legitimate
            basis for an independent probe for possible murder. <br> <br>



            <span class="spa"> REASON 4: THE KEY SUSPECTS ARE NOT IN CUSTODY:</span> ​Those who have been identified as the key accused from Rhea
            Chakraborty to Samuel Miranda to Showik Chakraborty by both the ED and the CBI have neither been detained
            (as of 17 August 2020), put in custody (as of 17 August 2020) nor arrested by the Mumbai Police. Further,
            Sandip Ssingh who claims to be Sushant’s “closest friend” , as per statements in the public domain, was
            among the first on the scene of death on 14th June, and has been named as the man who spoke to Sushant about
            Disha Salian as per multiple primary testimonies has told Republic TV that he has not been questioned by the
            Mumbai Police. <br> <br>



           <span class="spa">  REASON 5: MULTIPLE KEY WITNESSES & POSSIBLE SUSPECTS WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE MUMBAI:</span>​ Under the investigation
            by the Mumbai police, key witnesses and possible suspects seem to have been given a long rope. Sushant’s
            flatmate Sidharth Pithani was allowed to go to Hyderabad, staffer Dipesh Sawant who was in Sushant's house
            on June 14th has left the city, and housekeeper Samuel Miranda was allegedly told to remain silent by the
            cops as per his neighbours. <br> <br>



            <span class="spa"> REASON 6: THE EVIDENCE GATHERING IS IN QUESTION:</span> ​Getting the CCTV footage of the residence of Sushant Singh
            Rajput allegedly took 23 days for the Mumbai Police, not only raising questions on their efficiency in this
            case but also on possible tampering with key evidence.



            <span class="spa"> REASON 7: THE FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBLE DISHA SALIAN DEATH CONNECTION:</span> ​The Mumbai Police 58 days
            after the death of Sushant’s manager Disha Salian put out a statement calling for information from the
            public and asked those with evidence to come forward, instead of having carried out an investigation that
            reached its logical conclusion immediately. <br> <br>



           <span class="spa">  REASON 8: THE LEAKED VIDEOS PUT A QUESTION MARK ON THE MUMBAI POLICE INVESTIGATION:</span>​Leaked videos from
            Sushant’s room post his demise exist where a man, seemingly a cop, says “yeh kahin leak ho gaya toh hamara
            investigation barbaad ho jayega” ​(“if this were to leak, our investigation will get ruined”) ​ putting a
            huge question mark on the nature of the investigation by the Mumbai Police. <br> <br>



            <span class="spa"> REASON 9: THE CONCLUSIVE PROOF THAT THE HANGING WAS SUICIDAL OR HOMICIDAL IS NOT OUT​:</span> Despite over 2 months
            passing since Sushant’s death (as of 17 August 2020), the Mumbai Police has not been able to clearly state
            whether cause of death is suicidal or homicidal. All the post-mortem has identified is that the cause of the
            death is ‘asphyxia due to hanging’. <br> <br>



            <span class="spa"> REASON 10: THE RECORD OF ‘BRUISES, MARKS, INJURY’ MERITS REINVESTIGATION: </span>​ Allegations have been raised by
            parties, even during proceedings in the Supreme Court about how the Mumbai Police was required to make a
            report on the ‘bruises, marks, injuries’ and failed to do so. The mention of “bruises, marks and injury”
            itself raises serious questions on whether there was foul play involved. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
